# Audio Equalizer (MATLAB)

This MATLAB-based audio equalizer project for DSP Course.

## Features

### Audio Input
- Select any `.wav` audio file using a file browser.

### Band Modes
- **Standard Mode**: Predefined 9-band setup covering 0 Hz to 20 kHz.
- **Custom Mode**: User-defined frequency bands (5 to 10 bands).

### Filter Types
- **FIR Filters**: Hamming, Hanning, or Blackman windows.
- **IIR Filters**: Butterworth, Chebyshev Type I, Chebyshev Type II.

### User Input
- Gain per frequency band (in dB).
- Filter order (with default values if none provided).
- Output sample rate (in Hz).

### Signal Analysis and Export
- Magnitude and phase responses.
- Impulse and step responses.
- Poles and zeros visualization.
- All analysis data and plots exported to files.

### Output
- Composite signal generated by summing filtered and amplified bands.
- Comparison with the original signal in time and frequency domains.
- Final audio saved as a new `.wav` file.

## How to Use

1. Open the `audio_equalizer.m` script in MATLAB.
2. Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Select a `.wav` audio file.
   - Choose band mode (standard or custom).
   - Enter gain values for each band.
   - Choose filter type (FIR/IIR), filter order, and window/type.
   - Enter the desired output sample rate.
3. View the generated plots.
4. The output audio and analysis files will be saved automatically.

## File Outputs

- **equalized_output.wav**: The processed audio signal.
- **filter_analysis.mat**: MATLAB structure containing all filter properties.
- **/exports/** directory:
  - CSV files for:
    - Frequency response
    - Impulse response
    - Step response
    - Poles and zeros
  - PNG plots for:
    - Magnitude and phase responses
    - Impulse and step responses
    - Poles and zeros
    - Time and frequency comparisons
